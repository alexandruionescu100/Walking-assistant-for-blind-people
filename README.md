# Walking-assistant-for-blind-people
In this project we will implement an assistant for visually impaired people. The system that we will build will help visually impaired people to better orient themselves in the environment; The system will give them information about the obstacles in their path; In other words, we will create a system for detecting surrounding objects, and we will provide feedback with the help of some buzzers when we get too close to those objects;
